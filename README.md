Hello!
I'm Nerglej (aka William), and I am a student from Denmark.

I've been programming since I was 12 years old, and I've only gotten better since. I've made a lot of small Unity projects, coding in C#.
I've also coded in a lot of different languages like C, C++, Javascript, Python and more. Haven't done any .md files before though.
