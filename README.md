# About me

HiðŸ‘‹

I'm William. I've been programming for the bigger part of my life. I fell in love with it when I were quite young, and it just stuck with me.

I really love doing small side project, and also starting new, bigger projects, without ever finishing them!

I started out programming when I were 12 years old, mostly drawn by the game creation side of programming. I had big visions, but nothing ever really materialised to something, though I still think some of the ideas were great. I even managed to make a little 3D multiplayer to play with my friends when I were around 16.

I've always enjoyed reading technical papers, researching new and upcoming technologies. I'm quite curious by nature.

Currently I work at [Lareno A/S](lareno.dk), as a programmer. I've been doing a lot of different things here, but the biggest, by far, is the website. I got pretty much free hands when it came to the stack, and the site ended up doing exactly what it should, without being too complex, so it can be passed along to non-tech-savvy people.

In a short while I'll start as a "Datamatiker" which is easiest translated from Danish to taking Computer Science classes I think. I hope it'll go well!

# Projects

I've made A LOT of projects throughout the years, but here's a small list with some of my most notable ones (which aren't publicly available, kinda chronologically sorted, based on when I created them):

- First 2D/3D platformer in Unity, apparently inspired by a Paper Mario game, that I didn't know that time. And not at all that complex.

- 3D Multipler matchmaking game about throwing knockback bombs to push each other off the platform, with grappling hooks, and a very poor attempt at 3D modelling and animating.

- Authentication platform, with OTP (email and SMS), TOTP, SSO and Passkeys support, deliberately without password support, since I REALLY don't like them.

- Website, which is mentioned above.

# Programming languages I like

I've been around, seeing and trying a lot of different languages.

Here's a small list with those I'm comfortable with:
- Rust
- Flutter (Android and iOS)
- Javascript (NodeJS, Demo and browser)
- C# (ASP.NET and Unity)
- Java
- Go
- C++
- C

Enough about me, let's get started
