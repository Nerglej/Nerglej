# About me

Hi👋

I'm William. I've been programming for the bigger part of my life. I fell in love with it when I were quite young, and it just stuck with me.

I really love doing small side project, and also starting new, bigger projects, without ever finishing them!

I started out programming when I were 11 years old, mostly drawn by the game creation side of programming. I had big visions, but nothing ever really materialised to something, though I still think some of the ideas were great. I even managed to make a little 3D multiplayer to play with my friends when I were around 16.

I've always enjoyed reading technical papers, researching new and upcoming technologies. I'm quite curious by nature.

# Projects

I've made A LOT of projects throughout the years, so here's a small list with some of my most notable ones (which aren't publicly available, kinda chronologically sorted, based on when I created them):

- First 2D/3D platformer in Unity, apparently inspired by a Paper Mario game, that I didn't know that time. And not at all that complex.

- 3D Multipler matchmaking game about throwing knockback bombs to push each other off the platform, with grappling hooks, and a very poor attempt at 3D modelling and animating.

- Authentication platform, with OTP (email and SMS), TOTP, SSO and Passkeys support, deliberately without password support, since I REALLY don't like them.

- Website, which is mentioned above.

# Programming languages I like

I've been around, seeing and trying a lot of different languages.

Here's a small list with those I'm comfortable with:
- Rust
- Flutter (Android and iOS)
- Javascript (Generally web-development with, of course, HTML and CSS, and frameworks like React, Vue.js and Svelte)
- C# (ASP.NET and Unity)
- Java
- Go
- C++
- C

Enough about me, let's get started
