Hello!
I'm William. Currently I work a [Lareno A/S](lareno.dk), in the IT department.

I've been programming since I was 12 years old, and I've only gotten better since. I've made a lot of small Unity projects, coding in C#.
I've also coded in a lot of different languages like C, C++, Javascript, Python and more. Haven't really done any .md files before though.
