Hello!
I'm Nerglej (aka William), and is a student from Denmark.
I've been programming since I was 12-13 years old, and has only gotten better since. I've made a lot of small Unity projects, coding C#, mostly for learning stuff.
I've also coded in a lot of different languages like C, C++, Javascript and Python.
Right now I've setteled with the Godot gameengine using a mix of GDScript (Godot's built in language), C# and C++.
